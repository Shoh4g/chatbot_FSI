    "Mission of the Foundation: To promote the development in manufacturing industry and technology so as to better the livelihood of all Chinese people.\n\nThe Chiang Chen Industrial Charity Foundation was established in 1990 by Dr. Chiang Chen, founder and chairman of the Chen Hsong Holdings Limited. Dr. Chiang came to Hong Kong from his hometown in Shandong Province, China in 1949. Credit to his hard work and devotion to the manufacturing industry, he is recognized as a prominent leader in the industry and a much admired and respected role model for industrialists in China. Today, the Chen Hsong Group is one of the leading manufacturers of plastic injection moulding machines in the world and operates diversified business globally.\n\nHis belief in \"Enriching the Livelihood of People by Industry, Strengthening the Country through a Prosperous Society\" was inspired by the quick recovery of the economies of Japan and Germany after World War II. Dr. Chiang firmly believes that advanced manufacturing technologies will bring about the modernization of China and raise the living standard of all Chinese people. Dr. Chiang therefore donated all his shares of the Chen Hsong Group to establish the Chiang Chen Industrial Charity Foundation.",

    "The Hong Kong Blood Cancer Foundation is a non-profit charity organization founded by Professor Raymond HS Liang from the Haematology/Oncology Division of Queen Mary Hospital. The Foundation has invited Ms Chan Po Chu as Honorary Ambassador. We treat blood cancer with a positive attitude and perseverance. To us, every patient is a human individual with a unique set of needs. We are dedicated to providing them with the best support possible and we strive to improve the quality of life for both the blood cancer patients and their families. Our mission can be summed up in four branches:\n \t \n1)\tThe Foundation supports medical research projects, especially those with special reference to the unique pattern of blood cancer observed in Hong Kong. The effort aims to acquire new scientific knowledge and to identify previously unknown causative agents of blood cancer. This may result in effective prevention of some types of blood cancer in the future.\t \n2)\tThe Foundation supports technological developments, aiming to provide early and accurate diagnosis of blood cancer. Molecular tools may be utilized to monitor patients' follow-up treatments for blood cancer. These can help provide detection of disease relapse and the design of optimal treatment for individual patients. \n3)\tThe Foundation supports rapid introduction of effective state-of-the-art treatments for blood cancer to Hong Kong. This avoids delays that often arise because of limited public spending on hospital services. New treatments are often too expensive for the average patient.\t \n4)\tThe Foundation supports the provision of better support services to patients and their families. Comprehensive counseling programs and hotline services may be provided to cater to the socio-psychological needs of patients and their loved ones. Every effort is made to give specific attention to different categories of patients, including school children, adolescents, mothers, family breadwinners, single-parent families and elderly patients without family support.",

    "\"From Frozen Tears to Hope: Transforming Lives on the Ice\"\n\nIn the heart of our city lies a group of remarkable children who have known nothing but hardship, despair, and the cold, unforgiving embrace of the streets. These kids, often orphans and battling the clutches of addiction, have found an unlikely sanctuary in the world of ice hockey. Their stories are not just heartbreaking; they are a testament to the indomitable spirit of the human soul and the transformative power of sport.\n\nThe Suffering:\n\nImagine growing up without the warmth of a loving family, without a stable home to return to after school, and without the guidance of responsible adults. These children have faced unimaginable odds, enduring poverty, hunger, abuse, and the allure of drugs that threaten to consume their future. The streets they call home are unforgiving, and for many, the future looks bleak and uncertain.\n\nOur Mission:\n\nIn the face of such adversity, we've come together to create a glimmer of hope for these resilient young souls. Our mission is simple yet profound: to provide a safe haven where they can escape the harsh realities of their lives and discover their potential through the sport of hockey. We believe that every child deserves a chance to dream, to feel loved, and to experience the joy of belonging to a supportive community.\n\nOur Progress:\n\nOver the past year, we've made incredible strides in our mission to uplift these children from the depths of despair. Thanks to the generosity of donors like you, we've been able to:\n\nProvide Hockey Equipment: We've supplied each child with the necessary gear, ensuring they have the tools they need to develop their skills and stay safe on the ice.\n\nAccess to Coaching: Professional coaches have volunteered their time to teach these kids not just the sport of hockey, but valuable life lessons about teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.\n\nEducation and Mentorship: We've partnered with local schools to ensure that these children receive a proper education, and we've established mentorship programs to guide them through life's challenges.\n\nRehabilitation: For those struggling with addiction, we've connected them with rehabilitation centers and support groups, helping them take the first steps towards recovery.\n\nCommunity Building: Through weekly hockey practices and team-building activities, we've created a tight-knit community where these kids can find friendship, support, and a sense of belonging.\n\nThe Road Ahead:\n\nWhile we've made great strides, our work is far from over. We believe that every child has the potential to break free from the cycle of poverty and addiction, and with your support, we can continue to provide them with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive.\n\nBy contributing to our cause, you are not just funding a sport; you are helping us write a story of resilience, hope, and transformation. Together, we can turn the frozen tears of these children into smiles and dreams that reach far beyond the ice rink. Join us in creating a brighter future for these remarkable young souls.\n\n\n\n\n",
