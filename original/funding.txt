(a) Targeting high risk groups where most of the infections occur, with MSM being the most pressing priority so as to maximise the impact from limited resources. A relatively greater proportion of funds should be channelled to areas where most infections occur.
(b) Having clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that will be used at different stages of the programme to ensure that the objectives are reached. This is to ensure the accountability of the grantee and quality of the programme. Monitoring and evaluation should be an integral component of local AIDS programmes and be conducted at various levels during the different phases of planning and implementation.
(c) Mobilizing an effective community-based response, encouraging community partnership, support to serve hard-to-reach and vulnerable populations, and greater
collaborations between organisations.
(d) Adopting an evidence-based approach to address the prevention and care needs, making reference to the latest situations on epidemiology, strategic research findings and programme response.
(e) Addressing risk behaviours and vulnerability. Interventions for behavioural change should be relevant and acceptable to the target population. Programmes and projects should encourage active participation, dialogue and empowerment so as to achieve a greater coverage.	36	6.0	atf@dh.gov.hk	2125 2099			Marc Pangilinan/Nora		10/11/2023 5:07pm	FSI VA	6/3/2022 4:59pm	July 31, 2023 9:00 AM

We recognize that economic privilege greatly increases educational opportunities. Therefore, we fund organizations that provide access for all youth in our communities to educational experiences that will enhance their chances for future success.
- Eligible organizations must be within the greater metropolitan area of one of our US or Asia/Pacific offices, and approximately 70% of program participants must qualify as low income and be under the age of 26. (Organizations in the UK and Europe should refer to the firm’s  UK Foundation.)
- We fund organizations of various sizes but are primarily interested in those with budgets under US$2.5 million. We want to support organizations where our grants have a meaningful impact on youth, as well as the organization itself.
- We fund newer as well as more established organizations. We prefer to fund organizations that can demonstrate the strength of their leadership, have a measurable track record of success, and can exhibit an upward organizational trajectory.
- We fund religiously affiliated organizations that are inclusive of all participants regardless of religious background and beliefs.
- Scholarship programs are not eligible for funding.		7.0	jmellen@gmafoundations.com	(617) 399-1852	Autism Partnership, Principal Chan Free Tutorial World, Teach for Hong Kong	https://www.wellington.com/en/about-us/community-engagement#accordion-dfe7ba7656-item-90584a9c87	Marc		10/11/2023 5:07pm	FSI VA	15/4/2022 8:29pm	July 15, 2023 9:00 AM
Training Minds Sdn Bhd / NSI North South Initiative - Refugees to Rising Stars				Training Minds Sdn Bhd / NSI North South Initiative		Tax-Exempt Charity Organisation	Training Minds Sdn Bhd / North South initiative NGO	Refugees to Rising Stars	On behalf of Training Minds Sdn Bhd and the North South Initiative (NSI), I am writing to kindly request your support and assistance in sponsoring some students who are currently facing financial difficulties. When our programs began, we had imagined that the refugees we are working with would have the capacity to self-pay for their education. However, it has become apparent that unforeseen family emergencies and associated costs have presented significant challenges for them.

Your support would alleviate the financial burden on these students, allowing them to continue their education without undue stress. By investing in their future, you would not only be supporting their individual growth but also contributing to the broader community's development.

We firmly believe in the potential of these students and their ability to make a positive impact on society. Your generous sponsorship would provide them with access to education and serve as a source of inspiration, motivating them to overcome their current challenges.

If you are open to discussing this further or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We would be more than happy to provide you with any details you may need to make an informed decision.

Thank you for considering our request and for your continued commitment to empowering young individuals. Your support would mean the world to us and the students we serve.

When it comes to fundraising for education opportunities for refugees, it's essential to provide potential donors with a clear understanding of the eligibility requirements and how their contributions will make an impact. Here's an example of how you can elaborate on these aspects:
Title: Refugees to Rising Stars: Donate to Give Them Access to Education and a Brighter Future.
Description: Our fundraising campaign aims to provide educational opportunities to refugee youth, empowering them to overcome adversity and build a brighter future. Here are the key details and eligibility requirements for this funding opportunity:
1.	Targeted Beneficiaries: Our initiative focuses on refugee youth who have been displaced due to conflict, persecution, or other forms of displacement. We aim to support those who have limited or no access to formal education in their host communities.
2.	Age Group: The funding opportunity primarily targets school-aged children and adolescents, typically ranging from 18 – 35 years old. We believe that education is vital during these formative years and can provide a strong foundation for their personal and academic growth.
3.	Refugee Status Verification: To ensure transparency and accountability, we collaborate with reputable refugee organization NSI (North-South Initiative) and agencies to verify the refugee status of the beneficiaries. This verification process helps us reach those who are most in need of educational support. 
Your generous donations will not only provide education but also instill hope, resilience, and a sense of normalcy in the lives of refugee youth, empowering them to break the cycle of displacement and contribute positively to their communities and societies.
Thank you for considering supporting our cause and making a difference in the lives of refugee youth through education.	12		marketing.zara.tm@gmail.com / jainanak@gmail.com / pereira@nsinitiative.org	+6018-2742678 / +6012-3917532 / +60 12-290 0756	No this is our first time looking for funds 		Zarnaz Bhatti 		10/11/2023 5:07pm	FSI VA	20/6/2023 3:13pm	July 14, 2023 9:00 PM
The big church - NONE				The big church		Corporate Foundation	Susan Save  Lives	NONE	The project is aimed at increasing the computing capacity of the children, youth and the
people living in the non formal settlements of Nairobi. This project will give the mentioned
groups of people and the community at large opportunity of accessing vital tools that will help
prepare them in many other areas of life through internet and other digital related activities.
In this day and age, people are switching from general operations to digital operation, and
internet plays a critical role. The internet opens the citizenry to other global opportunities like
study, research, opportunities, business and others. It is very vital to open several centers that
will expose the youth and the people living in the non formal sectors. Through the Matandao
initiative, certain sectored issues related to the internet will be addressed like opening up of
an affordable cyber café, furnishing the center with a research unit, opening a resource center
for empowerment of the community and training a few young persons on maintenance issues
for both for the benefit of the community and the center.
2.0: Project background
Accessibility to internet facility in the non formal settlements has been an issue. System of
academics are also changing very fast with school going children getting exposed to
computers at an early age, but centers of empowerment to help bridge the gap are scarce.
The Kenyan government has a strategic plan of introducing computer usage as a regular part
of students learning process. This brings a need for such centers for non formal settlements
dwellers to help move in tandem with other slightly well to do areas. The one laptop per child
program is also in the process of being introduced.	susan 3.doc (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/28/28/1714298400000/9UQQb9MC2hFKfSzvHUfiRQ/pxQex8773BQa3jWwPkbTTOxjDW77PwPxHVnEReBM-EmFXqrthUF1ZrLSabGHZJaS6TS9lxQ4AM8dpnlZGpq9r7GbWJU-9gmL_wBrVQj4GL-23XNZusjCeyr3AnryflLBKDdvs9bxpYTOE3G3h0t8Eg/Zb5eKzQLPEB_G7LihIBvh8648he1kOHR9ZOHa3jCuPg)	WWW.SUSANSAVELIVES.ORG		SDG1: No Poverty	Children (persons under the age of 14)		Community Service	WWW.SUSANSAVELIVES.ORG	www.aahred.org		Open Year-Round		12/7/2023 7:56pm	Cash grant on reimbursement		$50000		Exclusive for charities	Income generating	12	2.0	fkevogo@gmail.com	+254711616193	AAHRED	WWW.AAHRED.ORG	Pastor Francis  Keya		10/11/2023 5:07pm	FSI VA	24/6/2023 8:00pm	July 12, 2023 11:56 AM

Health Bureau - Research Fund Secretariat		Active		Health Bureau		Government	Research Council (RC)	Research Fund Secretariat	The HMRF was established by the Health Bureau (HHB) in 2011 to make funding health-related scientific research more effective, by consolidating two former funds (the Health and Health Services Research Fund and the Research Fund for Control of Infectious Diseases) while also expanding the funding scope and injecting HK$1 billion into the consolidated fund.  In 2016, the approved commitment of the HMRF was increased by HK$1.5 billion to further expand its scope to incorporate the Health Care and Promotion Fund (HCPF), so as to achieve synergy and efficiency, and enhance flexibility in the deployment of funds.

The expanded HMRF provides support for the health promotion projects in addition to the support for health and medical research, research infrastructure, and research capacity building initiatives.  With added resources and a strengthened emphasis on evidence-based research, the HMRF will be able to fund health promotion projects of larger scale and bigger capacity for community participation, and facilitate the translation of science into practice through collaboration and partnership between academics and community organisations.  In 2021, the approved commitment of the HMRF was further increased by $1.3 billion to sustain its operation of the HMRF and to enhance its funding scope.

Health Bureau - Mental Health Initiatives Funding Scheme	checked	Active		Health Bureau		Government	Advisory Committee on Mental Health	Mental Health Initiatives Funding Scheme	As announced by the Chief Executive in the 2020 Policy Address, the social unrest in 2019, together with the persisting COVID-19 epidemic since early 2020, have brought different levels of impact and influence on the mental well-being of the people in the community. The Government has therefore decided to earmark $300 million under the Beat Drugs Fund for the aims of providing better support to the needy in the community and raising public awareness of mental health. The Advisory Committee on Mental Health (“ACMH”) is responsible for co-ordinating the initiative and working with service providers and non-government organisations in the relevant sectors to identify needs and set priorities, with a view to facilitating or promoting relevant projects.

Established in February 2020 with the Club’s injection of HK$100 million, more than 200 organisations have received grants from the Fund to implement over 240 projects and have helped over one million people from various sectors. In view of the rapid and serious fifth wave of the COVID-19 since January 2022, the Hong Kong Government has tightened the social distancing measures and raised the response level to Emergency, indicating the risk of health impact caused by COVID 19 is high and imminent. People who are financially deprived and from vulnerable groups are particularly hard hit. The second phase of the Fund was therefore rolled out on 21 February 2022 for providing imminent support to local vulnerable communities in mitigating the impact caused by the fifth wave of the COVID-19.

2006年，覺光長老將數十年來珍藏的紀念品捐出作義賣，以所得收益悉數捐出，成立「覺光法師慈善基金」，作為開展弘法、醫療、教育、安老、慈善濟助和佛教文化推廣等志業用途。 為成就覺光長老為法為人為眾生宏願，護法善長齊心輸將，共襄勝舉。「覺光法師慈善基金」於2006年11月20日正式註冊成立，並獲稅務局批准為豁免慈善稅機構。

基金現已展開工作，如早年國內四川地震災難及台灣風災，便即時撥出款項賑災。此外亦贊助印製特殊教育書籍，頒發助學金，出版覺光長老傳記等項目。	Reverend Kok Kwong Charitable Foundation Logo.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/28/28/1714298400000/JBRW-lgMVFJhN2oKPrRpIQ/4zIO3elyk6WpcZ50W08Zy1CDSl_uUPxVz676bt5EbdOaEsPgD9RUFQzEp8F4cCEX8VzD9Zd7I7fIAWBz3DSOJpc8nH1RqlP77w6RJ0GoZFlVfor0ED25ouF5ReWdaotzudAxjkqeH7uXXx6-1tyYIE3TYmWxvFOUokatCzmHK5XrboCSEa46KhCoR035jhAj/Oh49vlW_3NLEZ2KwMbfUDjqiMUBveyXWQ3aF-SoilB8)		Human Services,Public and Societal Benefit,Arts and Culture and and Humanities	SDG3: Good Health and Well-being,SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,SDG10: Reduced Inequality,SDG4: Quality Education	Other	General Public	Arts & Culture,Community Service,Disaster Relief,Education,Elderly Services,Social Services,Health Care	http://kokkwong-cf.org/	http://kokkwong-cf.org/form/plan01.pdf	Reverend Kok Kwong Charitable Foundation - 覺念計劃 - Application Docs.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/28/28/1714298400000/p4GwYXvQNsX2F7YTeQaKwA/HKs6q4WS9qf30ruNMYQJHkug8gFXd9KkDaRtTDaWuypYr1UhbdchG3M990NHOthBEvRiu4pVgI610VK6bYWVoBMHxQ0foFS6sceGS41QKWB9dboxPB1Ll6AUF3DNuBfaWUXCHdcg742ZR0WuNz6Jqml3kZTImqaevMxjk_wkhNG9UeEnRAjvmnjdBsuWN1Xu8SkiUNCMtSTMIzUhvJ19EQ/4e4QprVkqnKD5sDr16A-Yvx6dduqtFvcsyi8EMN8OxQ)	Deadline		31/3/2019 11:59pm	Cash grant with initial payment				Exclusive for charities	資助準則

Fok Ying Tung Foundation	霍英東基金有限公司	Corporate Foundation			The Fok Ying Tung Foundation (FYTF) was established by Hong Kong’s famous entrepreneur and philanthropist Dr. Fok Ying Tung in 1977. Dr. Fok was among the first to participate and support China’s Reform and Opening. His wish was to improving the prosperity and livehood of his country and people.

The Fok Ying Tung Foundation was established for these very purposes. Through the Foundation, DrFok has donated more than HK $6 billion in different programs to support regional development and the Reform, especially in the areas of education, healthcare, sports, science and cultural.

In the early 1980s, Dr. Fok recognized the strategic location of Nansha at the geographic center of the Pearl River Delta, its potential to become a modern city to connect Hong Kong and the Mainland, and a platform to further build the economy of Guangdong, particularly the west bank of Pearl River. In 1984, Dr. Fok, through Fok Ying Tung Foundation, began to participate in the construction and development of Nansha.

Jessie and Thomas Tam Centre		Active		Jessie and Thomas Tam Centre		Tax-Exempt Charity Organisation	Society for the Promotion of Hospice Care		The Society for the Promotion of Hospice Care (SPHC) advocates for quality and compassionate care for people with life-limiting illnesses and their families. Founded in 1986, we became the first hospice and palliative care training provider in Hong Kong and continue to promote the service through education and public awareness. In 1992, we established Bradbury Hospice, the first freestanding specialist hospice in Hong Kong. After three years of operation, we transferred the management of Bradbury Hospice to the Hospital Authority, signifying the incorporation of hospice care into Hong Kong’s public health care system.

In 1997, we opened the Jessie and Thomas Tam Centre (JTTC) to provide free bereavement counselling and support to people who have lost a loved one. In another critical milestone for our development, the Jockey Club Home for Hospice (JCHH) was realized thanks to a generous land grant from the Hong Kong SAR Government and construction funding from The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. JCHH opened its doors in 2016, introducing a contemporary, family-oriented hospice and palliative care service that offers inpatient, home, and day care, as well as bereavement support, life-and-death education and professional training programmes.

It is our hope that, through advocacy and exemplary care, we can enable more people to live a full, positive life and face death with dignity and peace.

For individual applicant, the applicant must be the sole inventor or one of the joint inventors of the invention.

For applicant company, the inventor(s) of the invention shall be a directly related party/parties to the applicant company, e.g. owner, shareholder, director, or staff. As the PAG is for first-time patent seekers only, funding support will not be provided if PAG has been granted to the applicant company's related companies (i.e. (1) company(ies) having a major shareholder (viz. those with 50% or more ownership) in common with the applicant company or (2) company(ies) without major shareholder(s) but having shareholders identical to those of the applicant company) before.

For an approved application, a grant of not more than HK$250,000 or 90% of the sum of the total direct cost of the patent application (including the cost for patent search-cum-technical assessment), whichever is the lower, will be provided.

Funds are only released to the implementation agent through which the patent application is processed. The grant is for covering the direct cost for patent search-cum-technical assessment, as well as other direct costs involved in the patent application process. Examples are attorney fees, consultant fees and filing of patent applications. Other expenses, including any costs incurred before the date of approval of the application and the renewal fee of granted patents, are not fundable. The grant is non-transferrable and will be valid for 3 years from the date of approval of the application. The grant may not be sufficient to cover the patent application expenses, and individual applicant/applicant company has to bear the remaining balance.		9.0	ipsc@hkpc.org	2788 5958			Marc Pangilinan		10/11/2023 5:07pm	FSI VA	15/5/2021 12:55am	#ERROR!

Such evidence can be employee records, tax returns, business transaction documents such as business contracts, invoices, etc.  Besides, the applicant should have been involved in recycling related operation with a proven track record for at least 1 year before submitting an application to the Recycling Fund, unless the applicant can provide exceptionally strong justification (e.g. companies with shorter period of establishment but have very experienced management / supervisory staff in recycling related operation)

These skills, which involve both theoretical and practical aspects of knowledge, also include financial literacy, enhanced communication and sound analytical interpretations. The Federation believes that these competencies need to begin as early as possible to make sure that young people grow up with the ability to adapt and change, becoming flexible in their approach to challenges, while also developing lifelong learning skills. This expectation of constant change is a challenge, but one that can be dealt if introduced early and with relevance. The HSBC Future Skills Development Project serves as the first step on what will become a lifelong journey of exploration and enhancement that augments skills for future employability.

A Better Tomorrow Foundation		Inactive		A Better Tomorrow Foundation	更好明天基金	Tax-Exempt Charity Organisation			A Better Tomorrow was initially set up in 1990 as a community service initiative. It serves as a continuation of the United Nations' A BETTER WORLD vision in 1989 to encourage community-wide participation to help build a better world. The initiative was later incorporated under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance as a non-profit company limited by guarantee.

Since 1990, A Better Tomorrow has donated substantial funding and participated in hundreds of projects ranging from education, environment, public health, youth, religion and social welfare. This includes establishing scholarships in universities, providing subsidies to projects for the underprivileged, and supporting voluntary services such as organising visits to homes for the aged and the young.

In recent years, as a result of more active participation in cultural activities, decision was made to set up the dedicated units of Chinese World Cultural Heritage Foundation and World Cultural Relics Protection Foundation to focus on such projects.

We work with our partners to address the multifaceted drivers of conservation threats, develop locally appropriate solutions, and monitor and assess impact while recognizing the interconnected and interdependent role played by sanctuaries within and around the priority landscapes. For captive apes in range states, the foundation focuses on sanctuaries that take steps to prevent breeding, provide lifelong care and rehabilitation for apes, and, when possible and appropriate, return residents back to their natural habitats.

The Chiang Chen Industrial Charity Foundation was established in 1990 by Dr. Chiang Chen, founder and chairman of the Chen Hsong Holdings Limited. Dr. Chiang came to Hong Kong from his hometown in Shandong Province, China in 1949. Credit to his hard work and devotion to the manufacturing industry, he is recognized as a prominent leader in the industry and a much admired and respected role model for industrialists in China. Today, the Chen Hsong Group is one of the leading manufacturers of plastic injection moulding machines in the world and operates diversified business globally.

His belief in "Enriching the Livelihood of People by Industry, Strengthening the Country through a Prosperous Society" was inspired by the quick recovery of the economies of Japan and Germany after World War II. Dr. Chiang firmly believes that advanced manufacturing technologies will bring about the modernization of China and raise the living standard of all Chinese people. Dr. Chiang therefore donated all his shares of the Chen Hsong Group to establish the Chiang Chen Industrial Charity Foundation.

Ching Chung Taoist Association of Hong Kong Ltd.		Active	Needs Translation/Cantonese Researcher	Ching Chung Taoist Association of Hong Kong Ltd.	道教香港青松觀 總辦事處	Tax-Exempt Charity Organisation			本觀屬全真教龍門派，派脈溯源於廣東廣州至寶台。1950年建壇於九龍偉晴街，1952年遷至彌敦道200號，1960年於屯門青山麒麟圍建立永久觀址，1974年增設九龍大南街觀址以配合屯門祖觀之發展。
　　青松觀自發韌初，即以慈善事業為壇務重點，除宗教服務外，因應社會需求設立義學、施米、贈醫施藥、發放救濟品、設立安老院等社會福利服務。七十年代獲政府批准設立中、西醫贈診所兩所，護理安老院、長者鄰舍中心，中、小學及幼稚園共七所。
　　內地改革開放後，本觀加強了與內地道教界之聯繫。在1994年及1996年先後捐資人民幣五百多萬，由中國道教協會分配予二百多間宮觀，作修復與拓展。對其他省市道觀的修復重建，亦皆慷慨協助，尤在1993年出資全力承擔廣東羅浮山黃龍古觀之重建，成一時佳話。
　　在弘揚道學方面，本觀先後創辦「香港道教學院」、「全真道研究中心」和「青松出版社」，對於推動道教文化的學術研究、傳播以及培養道教人才方面均發揮積極作用。	Ching Chung Taoist Association of Hong Kong Limited.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/28/28/1714298400000/JXOEiKN-4EPpv49S64LkeQ/UlJqJom-jpp8PGuTvxvFZQZ6ZXqpsNQHy_F1vvBQoKNhizTCH2SV23vF6ylVNeMzq7VGDUKBzihkiU6y5ALaRmNssVZ2YabqMxQmk8iXFbEW95xtt4VjzguouUnw-RsITC7SIcLVlS-n-R1mWQoBoYskJY-GLKMCWGFzRAtvyAlttUBfLIT-3xOSBiavJkPE/A05CnpTlShfBbR1-MVgqSiaS-Efg0gh3n7xovJ2eaAM)		Human Services,Religion Related,Education	SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,SDG3: Good Health and Well-being	Children (persons under the age of 14),Elderly,Those Under the Poverty Line,Youth (age between 15-24)		Education,Elderly Services,Children & Youth,Health Care	http://www.ccta.com.hk/index.htm			Unspecified			"Others, or unspecified"				Not Exclusive for charities				ccta@daoist.org	2393 7495			Marc	Ching Chung Taoist Association of Hong Kong Limited	10/11/2023 5:07pm	FSI VA	15/4/2022 2:33pm	#ERROR!

Development Bureau - Funding Scheme to Support the Use of Vacant Government Sites by Non-government Organisations		Active		Development Bureau	資助計劃以支援非政府機構善用空 置政府用地	Government		Funding Scheme to Support the Use of Vacant Government Sites by Non-government Organisations	At present, vacant government sites or school premises managed by Lands Department (“LandsD”) or other relevant authorities are available for use by non-government organisations (“NGOs”) through short-term tenancies (“STTs”). However, since these sites may have been left idle for some time, restoration or other engineering works are required before they can be put to use. To optimise the use of these sites, this Funding Scheme (“the Funding Scheme”) is set up, with $1 billion earmarked by Financial Secretary in 2018-19 Budget and approved by the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council, to provide NGOs with financial and technical support to make such vacant sites/school premises on government land fit for a variety of short-term community, institutional, or other non-profit making uses.		https://www.devb.gov.hk/filemanager/en/content_1126/Video_VGS_projects.mp4	Public and Societal Benefit	SDG9: Industry and Innovation and Infrastructure,SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities	Other	NGO's	Community Service,NGO Related,Sustainable Development	https://www.devb.gov.hk/en/issues_in_focus/Funding_Scheme_to_Support_the_Use_of_Vacant_Government_Sites_by_Non_government_Organisations/index.html	https://www.devb.gov.hk/filemanager/en/content_1126/Application_Form.pdf	Development Bureau - Funding Scheme to Support the Use of Vacant Government Sites by Non-government Organisations - Application Docs.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/28/28/1714298400000/C-4GWhXq1uo3EacCyEKaIQ/aZdxrHVDfzhTSANzCTOdO0au6wSWFAwu8CjUFzpOcUbXVkxAYP3aqKCW2i85JzslIATLV2s74OxMmJt36VtX-8rzcRVI2TK9p0ZnGp0Z2kwEWcD01jqesdIACaHxreb_azBeP5AYOluTFS3ZT_mgawXyTCn2MImZASX6nB2UMoZNYUOi9Hyj6JrlbWJEGKD0jVAaFj7U94RVXOEBHXvB_bECcovv_a4ir-e13Zav_ATuqWbEeq-hrAEd35f6J96GJfI4p6tWnVvAQF8Hv96E5lEw8b9oKIweA6burp4VAmI/2vHZCdHFmDL8_x6HIdtm17G4zaBX9JfSkVLY_5xHYLw)	Open Year-Round			Project-based Funding		$60000000		Exclusive for charities	1. The applicant should be an NGO which has already secured in-principle approval from LandsD or other relevant authorities under the existing mechanism1 for renting a vacant government site or school premises on a short-term basis.
2. The applicant should meet the following requirement –
(a) it should be a charitable institution or trust of a public character exempt from tax under section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112); or a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) or the former Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32) as limited by guarantee whose objects and powers do not include distribution of profits to members; or a non-profit-making society registered or body established under any legislation in Hong Kong; or
(b) it should take the form of a social enterprise, which should be –

Hong Kong Blood Cancer Foundation		Active		Hong Kong Blood Cancer Foundation	香港血癌基金	Tax-Exempt Charity Organisation			The Hong Kong Blood Cancer Foundation is a non-profit charity organization founded by Professor Raymond HS Liang from the Haematology/Oncology Division of Queen Mary Hospital. The Foundation has invited Ms Chan Po Chu as Honorary Ambassador. We treat blood cancer with a positive attitude and perseverance. To us, every patient is a human individual with a unique set of needs. We are dedicated to providing them with the best support possible and we strive to improve the quality of life for both the blood cancer patients and their families. Our mission can be summed up in four branches:
 	 
1)	The Foundation supports medical research projects, especially those with special reference to the unique pattern of blood cancer observed in Hong Kong. The effort aims to acquire new scientific knowledge and to identify previously unknown causative agents of blood cancer. This may result in effective prevention of some types of blood cancer in the future.	 
2)	The Foundation supports technological developments, aiming to provide early and accurate diagnosis of blood cancer. Molecular tools may be utilized to monitor patients' follow-up treatments for blood cancer. These can help provide detection of disease relapse and the design of optimal treatment for individual patients. 
3)	The Foundation supports rapid introduction of effective state-of-the-art treatments for blood cancer to Hong Kong. This avoids delays that often arise because of limited public spending on hospital services. New treatments are often too expensive for the average patient.	 
4)	The Foundation supports the provision of better support services to patients and their families.

Child Development Matching Fund		Active		Child Development Matching Fund	兒童發展配對基金	Tax-Exempt Charity Organisation			The Child Development Matching Fund ( CDMF ) was founded to address the issue of intergenerational poverty in Hong Kong and to support and complement the Child Development Fund ( CDF ) of the HKSAR Government. In 2009, the HKSAR Government established CDF for youth development with a view to alleviating intergenerational poverty.

Hong Kong is a world leading financial centre. Yet, behind its affluence, the city scores 0.539 in the Gini coefficient, a measure of disparity of wealth, indicating that Hong Kong is one of the places with the biggest wealth gap. Based on a research in 2018, there are about 180,000 children, or every 1 in 5 children, under the age of 18 lives in poverty.

“Inter-generational poverty” has been a deep-rooted societal issue impacting on the sustainable development of Hong Kong. It is against this background that the Government has introduced a policy through the Child Development Fund (CDF) to resolve inter-generational poverty by operating the scientific evidence-based youth development model of asset building.

A group of warm-hearted community leaders responded positively to the CDF by establishing the Child Development Matching Fund ("CDMF"). CDMF is a community based charity. It encourages the society at large to actively invest time, manpower, and financial resources to enrich our next generation. It helps its beneficiary youths to build tangible and intangible assets needed for their upward mobility, hence come out of poverty.

Make Ghetto kids happy play zone - Hockey Zone				Make Ghetto kids happy play zone		Tax-Exempt Charity Organisation	Kirinyaga Knights	Hockey Zone	"From Frozen Tears to Hope: Transforming Lives on the Ice"

In the heart of our city lies a group of remarkable children who have known nothing but hardship, despair, and the cold, unforgiving embrace of the streets. These kids, often orphans and battling the clutches of addiction, have found an unlikely sanctuary in the world of ice hockey. Their stories are not just heartbreaking; they are a testament to the indomitable spirit of the human soul and the transformative power of sport.

The Suffering:

Imagine growing up without the warmth of a loving family, without a stable home to return to after school, and without the guidance of responsible adults. These children have faced unimaginable odds, enduring poverty, hunger, abuse, and the allure of drugs that threaten to consume their future. The streets they call home are unforgiving, and for many, the future looks bleak and uncertain.

Our Mission:

In the face of such adversity, we've come together to create a glimmer of hope for these resilient young souls. Our mission is simple yet profound: to provide a safe haven where they can escape the harsh realities of their lives and discover their potential through the sport of hockey. We believe that every child deserves a chance to dream, to feel loved, and to experience the joy of belonging to a supportive community.

Our Progress:

Over the past year, we've made incredible strides in our mission to uplift these children from the depths of despair. Thanks to the generosity of donors like you, we've been able to:

Provide Hockey Equipment: We've supplied each child with the necessary gear, ensuring they have the tools they need to develop their skills and stay safe on the ice.

Access to Coaching: Professional coaches have volunteered their time to teach these kids not just the sport of hockey, but valuable life lessons about teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.

Education and Mentorship: We've partnered with local schools to ensure that these children receive a proper education, and we've established mentorship programs to guide them through life's challenges.

Rehabilitation: For those struggling with addiction, we've connected them with rehabilitation centers and support groups, helping them take the first steps towards recovery.

Community Building: Through weekly hockey practices and team-building activities, we've created a tight-knit community where these kids can find friendship, support, and a sense of belonging.

The Road Ahead:

While we've made great strides, our work is far from over. We believe that every child has the potential to break free from the cycle of poverty and addiction, and with your support, we can continue to provide them with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive.

By contributing to our cause, you are not just funding a sport; you are helping us write a story of resilience, hope, and transformation. Together, we can turn the frozen tears of these children into smiles and dreams that reach far beyond the ice rink. Join us in creating a brighter future for these remarkable young souls.

Age Range: Children eligible for this program must be between the ages of 10 and 16. This age range is chosen to provide critical support during their formative years.

Homeless or At-Risk: Eligible applicants in this age group must be either homeless or at-risk of homelessness. Proof of homelessness or at-risk status may include documentation from shelters, social workers, or school counselors.

Financial Need: Applicants and their families should demonstrate a significant financial need. This can be established through income documentation or a formal assessment by social services.

Commitment to the Program: Applicants and their families must demonstrate a genuine commitment to the program, including regular attendance at hockey practices, educational commitments, and active participation in any support or counseling services provided.

For Youths Aged 18 and Above:

Age Requirement: Eligible youths must be 18 years of age or older. This ensures that young adults who are no longer in the child welfare system but are still facing homelessness and financial hardships can access support.

Homelessness: Eligible applicants in this age group should be homeless or at risk of homelessness. Documentation from shelters, social workers, or other relevant agencies may be required to establish their homelessness status.

Financial Hardship: Applicants should be in dire financial circumstances, lacking the means to meet basic needs like housing, food, and clothing. Proof of financial hardship can be established through income documentation or formal assessments by social services.

Program Commitment: Similar to the younger age group, applicants in this category must demonstrate a strong commitment to the program, including regular participation in hockey activities, adherence to educational goals, and engagement in any necessary rehabilitation or counseling services.

Overall Considerations:

Application Process: Develop a straightforward application process for both age groups that collects necessary information and documentation to assess eligibility.

Selection Committee: Establish a selection committee responsible for reviewing applications for both age groups. Ensure that committee members are sensitive to the unique needs and challenges faced by homeless youths.

Confidentiality: Emphasize the importance of maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of applicants, especially given their vulnerable status.

Transparency: Maintain transparency in the selection process and regularly report on the program's progress to donors and stakeholders.

By focusing on these age-specific eligibility requirements, your funding opportunity can effectively target homeless and financially disadvantaged children and youths, offering them the support they desperately need to break free from the cycle of homelessness and achieve a brighter future through hockey and educational opportunities.	12	1.0	ezrakipchumba90@gmail.com	(075) 922-0182	Kirinyaga County	kipchumba.ezra@students.kyu.ac.ke	Ezra Kipchumba		10/11/2023 5:08pm	FSI VA	17/9/2023 2:18pm	#ERROR!
